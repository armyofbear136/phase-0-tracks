# List of elements in a form and what they do!

```
<form name="" action method="">
```
- this command starts the form object and defines its name in the system as well as the method to perform.


```
<fieldset>
```
- this seems to collect all the defined objects in its own 'form like table'


```
<label>"X"</label>
```
- this defines the text to be displayed for a fieldset element


```
<input type="" name="">
```
- this definies the arbitrary type of data being input for this element and the name of this element in the system


```
<input type="" name="" placeholder="X">
```
- this is similar to the other input, but this will put help text in the form box.


```
<select name="">
```
- this creates a list of option values to select from for a single element


```
<option value="">X</option>
```
- this is the holder for an option value under a ```<select name="">```


```
<input type="checkbox" name-"" value="agree">"X"
```
-This creates a checkbox with label X


```
<button type="submit">"X"</button>
```
-This creates a button that will allow us to submit our data entered.
