<h5>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</h5>
<p>HTML5 semantic tags give a clear definition of the element and article is probably the most useful element because it will handle a majority of crucial information in the page.</p>
<h5>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</h5>
<p>The order the browser uses to display elements on a page is &ltnav&gt -> &ltarticle&gt -> &ltaside&gt -> &ltfigure&gt -> &ltsection&gt -> &ltdiv&gt</p>
<h5>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</h5>
<p>We definitely learned how to make snippets. Snippets will be wildly essential to making web pages lightning fast!!!!</p>
<h5>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</h5>
<p>I think the most difficult concept was the sublime snippets just because we'd never looked at the documentation or had experience with XML. Learning what aside was used for was also tricky!</p>
