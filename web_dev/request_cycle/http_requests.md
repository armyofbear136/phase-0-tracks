What are some common HTTP status codes?

404 not found
200 ok
301 moved permanantly


What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

A GET request handles strings from the URL and passes them to the webserver from the browser as variables.

A POST request passes the same data as a GET request, but is passed to the webserver as part of the datastream as opposed to a static instance in the URL.


Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

Cookies are collections of data the webpage may use that are stored on the users computer.
