well since jquery is a library it must have a lot of neat functions we can use

first ill ask google just what is jquery

might check a quick tutorial

we'll have to see what kind of functions exist and how they manipulate data

we'll also have to see if there's any functions the relate to other coding languages

basically we need to look at the functions

once the information starts to get a little out of control or doesnt make sense, i think that's a good time to test some things out to efficiently clear things up
